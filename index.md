Hello, I am a Computer Engineering major and I plan on graduatin in 2029

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1
This was the first lab where we programmed the hello.world. The reasons this is one of my favorite labs is because it was my first time coding and really diving into the world of computer science. In this lab we used a simple cout command to print out our desired words but it was pretty cool geting to learn about it and now being part of the hello.world group.

Lab 4, Part 2
The reason for this lab being my favorite is because of the guesing aspect and it being a game that can be played with 2 people. It reminds me of the old video games like Tetris or Pong. For this lab we used if-statements to print out if the guess was either too high or too low. If the guess was correct then the loop would finish and the game would end.

Lab 7
This lab was really difficult in my opinion because it really tested the logic of time and interperting into the coding.Althoguh it was difficutl to wrap my head around at first, seeing it come together and actually running made it all the more satisfying. In this lab we used if-statements, bool conversions, and vectors to put together code that will advise if you can or can't park in the selected time.
